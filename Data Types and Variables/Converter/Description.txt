Converter

You want to buy this really cool car from the UK, but you are worried about the fuel consumption. The values you see are MPG (miles per gallon). You have no idea what 20 MPG means so, being a programmer, decide to write a converter that helps you calculate the consumption.

Doing some research, you learn that 1 gallon = 4.54 litres and 1 mile = 1.6 km.

After the calculation, round the result down to the nearest whole number.

Input
On the first line you will receive a number m - miles per gallon

Output
On the only line of output, print {result} litres per 100 km

Constraints
1 <= m <= 100

Input
20

Output
14 litres per 100 km

Input
44

Output
6 litres per 100 km
