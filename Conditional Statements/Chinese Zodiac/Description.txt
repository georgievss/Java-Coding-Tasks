Chinese Zodiac

The Chinese zodiac assigns an animal to year according to the following table:

Year	Animal		Year	Animal
2000	Dragon		2006	Dog
2001	Snake		2007	Pig
2002	Horse		2008	Rat
2003	Sheep		2009	Ox
2004	Monkey		2010	Tiger
2005	Rooster		2011	Hare

Write a program that determines the zodiac sign for a particular year. Note that the cycle repeats itself, so 2012 will be the year of the Dragon again.
