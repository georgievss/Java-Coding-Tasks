Min Max Sum Average

Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of N real numbers and returns the minimal, the maximal number, the sum and the average of all numbers (displayed with 2 digits after the decimal point).

The input starts by the number N (alone in a line) followed by N lines, each holding an real number.
The output is like in the examples below.

Input
On the first line, you will receive the number N.
On each of the next N lines, you will receive a single real number.

Output
You output must always consist of exactly 4 lines - the minimal element on the first line, the maximal on the second, the sum on the third and the average on the fourth, in the following format:
min=3.00
max=6.00
sum=9.00
avg=4.50

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000
All numbers will be valid numbers that will be in the range [-10000, 10000]
