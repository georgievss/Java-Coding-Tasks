Strange Order

Write a program that orders a list of numbers in the following way:

3,-2,1,0,-1,0,-2,1 -> -2,-1,-2,0,0,3,1,1
You need to find out the criteria for yourself by looking at the example. You can also check the example below.

Input
On the only line of input, you will receive the numbers, separated by a comma.

Output
Display the list with the mysterious ordering applied removed, separated by a comma.

Input
3,-12,0,0,13,5,1,0,-2

Output
-12,-2,0,0,0,3,13,5,1
